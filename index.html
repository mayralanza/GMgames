            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Produced by series veteran Jun Takeuchi, this next-generation follow-up to the terrifying series introduces the theme of escape as its core survival instinct. As Chris Redfield (former S.T.A.R.S. member and now part of the BSAA unit), your life is in danger as you strive to complete your most dangerous mission yet in a sweltering desert colony where a new breed of evil has been unleashed. Swarms of marauding evil beings will charge at you when your pulse is racing at a heart-shattering pace. Environments will play a bigger factor than ever here, using the power of next-gen systems to create a world where terror might lurk in any alcove or shadow. Powerful lighting effects overwhelm the player with mirage movement and blinding brilliance, and even in the light of day, there is no safe haven in this Resident Evil. </p>

She is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and by Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Her voice is so awesome. </p></li>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class = "lol">Final Fantasy XIII is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3. Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth major installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game includes fast-paced combat, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. Final Fantasy XIII includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as susmmoned monsters, chocobos, and airships. Love to plan strateies and fine graphics? This is your game. Your welcome! :) lol</p>

                    <p> We don't think like that; when we think there's no hope left we keep looking until we find some. Maybe Cocoon is past saving, but we'll protect it or die trying. We live to make the impossible, possible - that is our focus.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game</p>
